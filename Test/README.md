## Types of testing
### Functional Testing
1. Unit testing: testing a single unit of code or individual functions or classes.
2. Integration testing: testing how well two functions work together.
3. End to end testing: Runs the application in a simulated environment and attempts to emulate the actual use and behaviour of the application.
4. Acceptance testing: Testing the application to ensure that it meets the user's expectations and requirements.
5. System testing: Testing the application to ensure that it is running correctly and that it is not crashing on actual servers (even if it works on localhost).
6. Smoke testing: Testing the application's most important tests first to ensure that the application isn't on fire before proceeding to the rest of the tests.

### Performance Testing
1. Performance testing: Testing the application's performance.
2. Load testing: Testing the application's performance by simulating a load on the application.
3. Stress testing: Testing the application's performance by simulating a high load on the application.

### Usability Testing
1. Usability testing: Testing the application's usability.

### Security Testing
1. Security testing: Testing the application's security.
